\section{ Analytic Coordinate System for the Ogive-Cylinder at Angle of Attack}

Since the generalized three-dimensional code to be developed will be
numerically evaluating the transformation coefficients, it will be useful to
solve a simple problem using both analytic and numerically evaluated
coefficients. For this analysis, a coordinate system will be described for use
in solving flow fields about an ogive-cylinder at angle of attack.

To simplify the analysis, the coordinate system will be a modified cylindrical
system centered on the body axis. At any axial station, the computational
domain will extend from the body outward to a specified outer limit. The outer
boundary will be a circle with its center shifted off of the body axis to allow
the bow shock to be more nearly aligned with this boundary.

The outer boundary radius and offset point location will vary linearly with $x$.
The details of this system are shown in the following figures.

The transformation will be describes as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\xi &= \xi(x) \\
\eta &=  \eta(x,r,\phi) \\
\delta = \delta(\phi)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

It will be desirable to allow the step size to vary away from the body in order
to compress points in the boundary layer near the body for the present. This
variation will be defined as some function of the fractional distance between
the body and outer boundary. In this case , $\eta$ will be defined as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\eta = \eta(\overline{r}) \\
\overline{r} &= (r - r_b)/(r_s - r_b) 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The required transformation functions are:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
F_x &= \xi/_x F_\xi + \eta_x F_\eta \\
F_r &= \eta_r F_\eta \\
F_\phi &= \eta_\phi F_\eta + \delta_\phi F_\delta
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
