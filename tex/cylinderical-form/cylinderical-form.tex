\section{Derivation of the Cylinderical Navier Stokes Equations}

In this section the system of governing equations given previously will be
expanded in a cylinderical coordiniate system.

For cylinderical ($x$,$r$,$\phi$) coordinates, the velocity vector
$\va{V}$ is given by:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_1}

where $\hat{e_x}$, $\hat{e_r}$, and $\hat{e_\phi}$ are the unit vectors.

The grad $\grad$ operator may be given as:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_2}

Since the analysis that follows will require taking derivatives of the unit
vectors, these expressions will be derived next.

The position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ may be written in cartesian coordinates as:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_3}

Now the equations for the unit vectors are:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_4}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_5}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_6}

From these equations, the derivatives of the unit vectors can be found:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_7}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_8}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_9}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_10}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_11}

Using these expressions, the derivatives of a general vector function become:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_12}

where $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ are the vector components.

\subsection{Continuity Equation}

The continuity equation will be expanded first:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_13}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_14}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_15}

After rearranging and combining terms, we get this form:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_16}

\subsection{Momentum Equation}

Before expanding the momentum equation, it will be convenient to use the
following for the shear stress matrix:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_17}

Where:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_18}

In this investigation, body forces will be neglected. The momentum equation
becomes:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_19}

or

\import{eqns/}{eq3_20}

By expanding this last expression and rearranging terms, the following form
results for the momentum equation

\import{eqns/}{eq3_21}

In order for this vector equation to be valid, the component equations must also be valid. Thus the momentum equation will be satisfied if the following three equations are true:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_22}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_23}

\import{eqns/}{eq3_24}

\subsection{Energy Equation}

The expansion of the energy equation follows:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_25}

This form will be recast using the definition of total enthalpy:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_26}

thus:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_27}

and the energy equation becomes:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_28}

Finally.the expressions for the shear stress components should be derived:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_29}

The $\grad\va{V}$ matrix has the following form:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_30}

Thus, the shear stress components are:

\import{eqns/}{eq3_31}
