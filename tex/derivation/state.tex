\subsection{State Equations}

The remaining equations needed to complete the set are the constitutive
relationships for the working fluid. In this investigation the fluid is a
prefect gas and obeys the thermal state equation:

\import{eqns/}{eq2_32}

where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. If $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant
pressure, and $c_v$ is the specific heat at constant volume, and if $\gamma =
\frac{c_p}{c_v}$ are given, then the caloric state equation is

\import{eqns/}{eq2_33}

The definition of the static enthalpy may be given by:

\import{eqns/}{eq2_34}

Recalling the definition of the substantive derivative:

\import{eqns/}{eq2_35}
