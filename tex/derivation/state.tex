\subsection{State Equations}

The remaining equations neede to complete the set are the constituative relationships for the working fluid. In this investigation the fluid is a prefect gas and obeys the thermal state equation:

\begin{equation}
  P = \rho R T
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. If $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $c_v$ is the specific heat at constant volume, and if $\gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v}$ are given, then the caloric state equation is

\begin{equation}
  e = c_v T
\end{equation}

The definition of the static enthalpy may be given by:

\begin{equation}
  h = c_p T = e + \frac{P}{\rho}
\end{equation}

Recalling the definition of the substantive derivative:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{Df}{Dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \overrightarrow{V}\cdot\nabla f
\end{equation}
